Changes to LWIP v1.4.1:
-----------------------

Please keep this file updated, whenever fixes are added or removed. Or if the version of LWIP ported is changed.
As much as I'll like to make a clean port of LWIP, it was clearly not made to support a kernels like our EE and IOP kernels.

1. Critical-region protection within core/mem.c now disables interrupts:
	There's this part in pbuf_free() of core/pbuf.c:
	      /* p->flags == PBUF_FLAG_RAM */
	      } else {
	        mem_free(p);
	      }
	...that might cause a race conditions because that fragment of code is run with interrupts disabled,
	while mem_free() will use Semaphores to ensure access control.

	However, according to the SONY documentation for WaitSema,
	such a move will cause the interrupt-inhibited state to be interrupted.
	That would allow other threads to run, which might trash up pbuf.c's internal variables.

	The critical region protection code within mem.c has been changed to not use a semaphore instead,
	in the interest in keeping the low-level functions (pbuf and mem) lightweight.

	While it can be said that this is a bug, LWIP is currently designed to assume that the semaphore-management
	functions will not do anything to the state of interrupts in the system.

2. Critical-region protection within api/sockets.c now uses a semaphore:
	The sockets layer was originally protected by disabling interrupts. However, the event_callback function
	would attempt to signal a semaphore when interrupts are disabled, leading to similar consequences to #1.
	The faulting location is here, within event_callback itself:
		    if (scb->sem_signalled == 0) {
	... as scb some invalid value because select_cb_list got modified by another thread when the
	interrupt-inhibited state got interrupted.

3. Added missing import directive for lwip/sys.h to core/dhcp.c:
	Added to inhibit compiler warnings about the implicit use of malloc() and free() by the IOP-side LWIP port,
	as the IOP-side libraries and header files do not provide standard malloc() and free() functions.

4. Removed include directive for stdlib.h, in api/netdb.c.
