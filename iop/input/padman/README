freepad is a free replacement module for XPADMAN.
freepad is based off XPADMAN v3.6, which is the last known version of XPADMAN.
It was originally based on a module around v3.0.

I'd like to thank pukko for libpad(x), Hanimar for ps2dis, [RO]man for
padspecs.txt and Marcus R. Brown for sio2log.

You can uncomment -DDEBUG in the makefile, to build a debug version which prints
debug output to stdout.
