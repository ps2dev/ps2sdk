	Sorry, but even I can't explain the syntax used here. :(
	I know that _ori_gp has to be "early-clobbered" and the GP register will get clobbered... but I don't really know why GCC can't determine which registers it can and can't use automatically. And I don't really understand what "clobbering" registers is.
